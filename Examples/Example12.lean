# Example 12 — `SUM(CASE…)` + `HAVING` ≡ `WHERE` + `SUM` + `HAVING`

Filtering inside the aggregate with `CASE` equals filtering rows with `WHERE` before
aggregating — so the planner may push `status = 'completed'` into a `WHERE`.

## The two SQL queries being proved equivalent

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) AS completed_total
FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) > 1000;
                                  ≡
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS completed_total
FROM orders WHERE status = 'completed' GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 1000;
```

The whole-result equality is *set-level* (the two `GROUP BY`s scan different relations, so row
order is unspecified — fine for SQL). Its entire content is the **per-customer-group** identity
below, on the `TypedRelation` algebra: the `CASE`-`SUM` over a group equals the plain `SUM` over
that group's `WHERE`-`restriction`. The `HAVING > 1000` test, applied to equal values, then
agrees too.
